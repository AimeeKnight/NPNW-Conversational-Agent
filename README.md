NPNW Conversational Agent

#### Overview
This project is a Search & Synthesis Application that allows users to:

Ask questions and get answers powered by an LLM (Large Language Model).
Upload a PDF file to augment the model's response with additional context.
Use a simple frontend built with Google Material Design for user interaction.
Leverage a backend written in Node.js with LangChain for organization and handling LLM interactions.
